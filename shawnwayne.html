The story has come to the beginning
Wayne.

[Verse 1: Shawn Wayne]
Yes, Shawn Wayne. 
A lot of stupid questions, I'm sitting in front of the baby.
Black guys don't come in, we're not part of the family.
Chip has already received his toys. 
It's in my interest to make money, not to touch the ground with the guys.
It's been over a year since I promised my family, and now I've definitely found my Marina.
She is very kind to me, we had a good beer together.
A formal suit, this is the first time I've touched it. 
I usually prefer tracksuits, but right now it's about money.
My sister got all the knowledge she was given
Now we need to move on, forget it.
Mother has shed enough tears, it's time to make her happy (make her happy)
And a nigger can only argue with friends
I hope Whitney turns our family into hippies.
Am I on the fifth, seventh, tenth day now? at the studio. 
I'm living this shit.
It's not about the fucking S-D-M.
The horn sounded, it says M&M.
My beloved brother, you can wait. 
Chip and I are working comrades now. Now we are happy, we have been accepted into the family. 
But after two hours of drinking, death calls me...">

At what point did I enter the wrong room?
It's like, like a scythe in my hands.
I'm walking down the corridor, it's too narrow here.
Money is nothing more than a thing, but it helps to survive.
Now I'm looking for salvation in myself, but the assistant is only a God.
I'm standing alone and I don't forget to use my tongue.
Surrounded by love, but I feel lonely.

[Chorus - MurdaL]
Money in the ghetto, we hustle through the night,
Chasing down our dreams, till we make it to the light.

[Verse 2 - Shawn Wayne]
Thanks for helping with this, nigga. None of the Waynes would be broadcasting right now.
I don't want my sister to change her residence permit
Because of his younger brother's stupidity
Thank you Mom, you gave me everything I needed. 
It's time to thank you and come back pumped.
The road was divided into two descents, you can distract yourself and take care of yourself
But the stupid boy chose the second goal, now he will have to spend a health bar
I've been here all day, I didn't need a call. 
The boss is going to go to the airport, something is waiting for us. What?
A rude conversation was heard, the ancestors obviously would not be happy to learn that I was picked up by the Japanese Mafia.
It was easy to get the money, anyone who entered the base would be naked.
The work takes place on the street, it will be impossible to see how the girls undressed.
Based on my thoughts, Mom is now helping her sister. 
The fact is that you have to treat niggers.
My brother likes to inhale cigarette smoke.
Maybe something stronger, but we're at work.
I'll be realistic. Thinking is narrow, you have to ask again. I have zero skills, but I have to help.

[Verse 3 - MurdaL]
In the shadows of the streets, where the hustle never sleeps,
Every day we grind, chasing dollars and our dreams.
Born into the struggle, but we rise above the trouble,
Counting every penny, making paper by the double.
Survival of the fittest, in the land of the gritty,
Where the strong survive, and the weak get no pity.
From the corner stores to the alleyways we roam,
Making something out of nothing, this is how we make a home.

[Chorus - MurdaL]
Money in the ghetto, we hustle through the night,
Chasing down our dreams, till we make it to the light.

[Verse 4 - Shawn Wayne]
The whores have been left behind, several cars are rushing.
I've outgrown this shit, but to slacken now is to be a pussy.
An easy photo shoot, everyone got their own pen.
The niggas on the other hand have already appeared, they look like fans.
Shot after shot, women screaming. I don't understand their language and fuck it.
The nigga died on the spot, my brother threw me in the car, it's time to get back.
The work continues, everyone has forgotten about what happened.
And if winning means someone's death, I'd rather lose, Lord.
But when you threaten me and my family, you have to implored.
But when you threaten me and my family, you have to implored.">

Is there anything you want to share?

[Verse 1: Shawn Wayne]
I want to tell you to fuck off.
My mother won't find out, I went to the bros. 
There's a problem with me, the rider on the horse.
My head is on fire, I have doubts, 
but when I see a bunch of confident faces, I want to roll the dice.
The nigga doesn't know yet that his store is serviced by a cleaning service.
Harsh realities, nine hundred and ninety-two.
Nerves cause aggression, ay ay ay
A big deal requires patience, ay ay ay
But I remained bald, now my tongue feels salt.
Tomorrow I will help my sister, she doesn't know anything, she's not in the game.
At the time, it all seemed like a game with a happy ending.
The euphoria came and made San Andreas skate.

[Chorus: Shawn Wayne]
The same feels, same feels, same feels and city miss.
We don't need to get high wheels to get euphoria feels.

[Verse 2: Shawn Wayne]
Mouse didn't appreciate it, I tried so hard, but he was exhausted.
The diss caused the same feelings.
I'll say the same about my sister. She has succeeded, and I will help her with this.
Got something to say, my nigga? I know it's not. 
You've been very busy promoting cloud, these feelings are back.
King Sean Wayne - repeat those words. 
Black remains black, even after years. 
My connections won't go anywhere, but I'm retired now.
May ears? May tits 
All I son is to throw away the phone. After all, no one will jerk off anymore, leaving a shot
Modesty, poverty, your environment - all this will bring up a good person, tight belt
It's not for me to judge, I was raised according to Stanley's laws. 
But as you get older, you realize
San Andreas makes euphoria, it's better than spice

[Chorus: Shawn Wayne]
The same feels, same feels, same feels and city miss.
We don't need to get high wheels to get euphoria feels.">

IDLEWOOD KID, WHAT ARE YOU TURNING INTO?

[Verse 1 - Shawn Wayne]
Started from the bottom, where the sun rarely shines,
Battling the darkness, with his rhythm and his rhymes.
On the block with his homies, spitting fire every day,
Nigga signed his first deal, but the grind didn't stop,
In the studio late nights, aiming for the top.
First shit dropped, the hood showed love,
From the streets to the charts, he fit like a glove.
Now he’s on top, but he stays humble and true

[Chorus - inferno]
Crown on the head
Crown on the head
Nigga was crowned
Crown on the head, bitch

[Verse 2 - inferno]
Just a kid from the block with a mic in my hand,
Dreaming of the stage, trying to make a stand.
Writing rhymes in my room, late nights on the grind,
Every beat, every line, reflecting what's on my mind.
Watching the legends, hoping one day I'll be next,
Spitting fire at the cyphers, giving everything, no less.
Recording in the basement, with a makeshift booth,
Every track a step closer to uncovering my truth.

[Chorus - inferno]
Crown on the head
Crown on the head
Nigga was crowned
Crown on the head

[Verse 3 - Shawn Wayne]
Eyes on the prize, though the journey's just begun,
Gotta stay focused, keep my vision on the run.
From the ghetto to the stars, I know it's a climb,
But I'm ready for the hustle, ready to shine.
No one will feel sorry for me, all niddas play villains.
It feels like only my eyes are not lying.
You died a brave death, little frog.
I'm going to dance on this grave of creeps walk.
One, two, three, four, five - A hot ten will suck me.
A couple of racists will get bang.

[Chorus - inferno]
Crown on the head
Crown on the head
Nigga was crowned
Crown on the head">

- Why did you come all this way, Shawn? What is the moral?
- I do not know, mister. All I want is to express myself.

[Verse 1]
Still, he kept silent about what happened after the shooting.
Only four letters fit into the remington, the fourth letter.
It meant a lot to me, it matters.
Chip was driving and Marina was directing him. 
A boss and a wonderful girl, I've been in love with her since the very beginning of my job.
Her brother Joe and I were in the shadows. He got off lightly, but we were proud of him, he knows.
The rush of adrenaline, I felt bad. Marina refused the request to turn to the bar.
Now the Rem was rolling towards Blue-bar-ry.
The trunk was full of beer bottles. I'm not a drinker, but the situation is fascinating.
The moon helps to avoid an accident, Los Santos is too long, we hardly left it.
The steering wheel in the nigger's hands slid like soap.
The road has become sloped
Turning onto the beach, the car was left alone. Joe unfolded the tents and offered to jump into the water.
I sat on the sidelines and watched Marina
She didn't undress, but I was definitely something seen a.
The nigga was drinking alcohol, after throwing out a few words about Chappie, he walked away.
My gun was still in my pocket, I threw it to hell anyway.
It's the middle of the night, only the stars are visible. 
Marina noticed a triangle in the sky, this is a constellation. With that, she began a dialogue.
Her charming appearance caught my eye
Again
Her charming appearance caught my eye
She collapsed next to me, her words were so hypnotic.
Joe was already asleep, the chip was missing. Hope it.
I hope this is what I think, Marina slowly crawled down. 
Her sweet lips made me sob with pleasure.
I was experiencing high blood pressure.
That night was my first adult experience, little Shawn fell head over heels in love with Marina.

[Verse 2]
The eldest woke me up before the others.
Now we need to lay low, our people are unlikely to be happy about contacts with Asians.
Tears welled up in my eyes, this is the last meeting with her.
Chip said it's not the North Shore, it's the West Coast.
I won't feel like a unit anymore.
I won't feel alive.
My only love is in the past, now we're on the run.
Home, Idlewood Street. Our ancestors greeted us with stories about the state in Nigeria.
Just for fun. 
Who knows how long Wayne Jr. would have had to live if Chip hadn't picked him up that night.
The Mafia could have eradicated the source of Rap, but eventually heard the designation of the ultimate difference. But I'm estranged.
The parameter has changed.">

[Intro: Shawn Wayne]
I don't know what I'll tell you next time, maybe it won't be.
Twenty-seven plus sixty-three, you should look into prayer.
A lot of shit, harm and shame - all that comes from w.
I know niggas like to be bad, but why are you bad in San Fierro?
This message has been preparing for eight thousand days, many will get bored now.
About The Fate That Was Known part one, I stop this stream of thoughts.
I'm sorry, I'm not tired of apologizing. I've finally done and I'll keep working on it.
Throughout my speech, you have observed the story of Siddhartha.
Now it's time to put everything in its place and drop the burden of doubta.

[Bridge]
Oh, Shawn Wayne. How many times have I told myself that I will never leave the comfort zone?
My angels would never recognize me now.
It wasn't an apple that fell on my head so that I would understand what a gangster is.
Soon I got a feeling like Julius, I'm doing so many things now.

[Verse 1: Shawn Wayne]
Alcohol, whores, fights and shooting. Now it's nothing but shame, an vow.
I swear that all this is behind me, there are two letters s left behind me, and my crowd.
You've already heard all the names, Fernand was a good man, I can't say a bad thing.
Niggas have started a whole war, a ring lover doesn't like hookahs.
Something that cannot be understood after hearing, books has.
I had to see one Brutus, didn't I already mention Julius?
The conflict between the Offroad and the Smile has faded away, I was not impressed.
Hip-hop needs a boost and definitely not in the form of a diss on Poirier.
What am I writing about? This is a whole epic about Internet lovers.
Each step must be analyzed and benefits extracted.
Are you listening to this movement stuff?
Nigger, it's the whole universe to me. I don't think there is a person on staff who works on texts at night caption.
But this is a legacy issue. When you want to defeat it, you will have to change the population.
I'm not rich, B-Wayne is ahead and that's no reason to be jealous.
I am driven by love for my family and recognition, no one will charge me a percentage.
I will be humiliated only in front of the creator, but until then I will exalt myself.
By self rated my last album as shit, removing it from the sites.
High I conclude this divine essay with a big one.

[Verse 2: Shawn Wayne]
Let's not go into details, everyone will understand what happened anyway. 
It was nine, there was one left, on the way.
A lot of time has passed since then, survivor's mistake. It's a familiar feeling. I was inspired by the morality of pglang.
But I have accepted my fate and I will set a good example.
Only God can humiliate me, until then I exalt myself. Counterexample
Why are they so angry, where is their punishment? I sent the money and would like to help young infant.
The past work remained in the shadows, joy and freedom in the soul.
It was time to turn over all the cards, it was a big foul.
The platforms will not be seen, people will not hear. Deleted due to bad feelings.
San Andreas, Idlewood, Los Santos. The message has come to an end, I am proud of it.
I am proud of it.

I can't save myself if I don't realize where I'm wrong.

[Verse 1 - inferno, Shawn Wayne, Lorraine Adams]
Fucking bullshit about success and invincibility, it's all about playing to cover the truth.
Save yourself, only you can do it.
Call your loved ones for help, but make sure they're not rats.
There's a lot of talentless people out there, they're saints.
But when it comes down to it, they're empty inside.
We're made of a different breed, we're not easy to kill, even in the worst weather.
Everybody's got a flaw, but you gotta keep an open mind, get rid of it, make it right.

Piles of joints, lots of behinds, I left it behind.
There's no shortage of reasons, try to take it out of context.
There's a reason for their pretenses, they're just jealous of us
There's no way around it, we're the leaders.
The key is around our necks, look into our souls.
Anyone can open the door, but not everyone will understand.
I'm armed and protected, I've been building it for years.
But everyone's got flaws, once opened, live the truth.
